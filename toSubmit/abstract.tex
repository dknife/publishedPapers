In this paper, we proposed an improved crossover method for genetic approach to travelling salesman problem (TSP). Since the valid solution of TSP is an ordered permutation, traditional crossover methods do not guarantee the valid off-springs and fast convergence. Therefore, researchers have proposed special crossover, and it is known that SCX is superior to other methods in the aspect of convergence speed and fitness of the genes. In this paper, we extend the SCX to have bidirectional and circular search properties in the off-spring construction. The proposed BCSCX shows the better convergence speed and even better solution that those of SCX in the empirical experiments.
